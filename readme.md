WP-Invoice 4.0 is the most popular and flexible plugin for WordPress that allows you to make your site accept payments. Complete e-commerce solutions out of the box. Flexible and extendable.

WP-Invoice lets WordPress blog owners send itemized invoices to their clients. Ideal for web developers, SEO consultants, general contractors, or anyone with a WordPress blog and clients to bill. The plugin ties into WP's user management database to keep track of your clients and their information.

Once an invoice is created from the WP admin section, an email with a brief description and a unique link is sent to client. Clients follow the link to your blog's special invoice page, view their invoice, and pay their bill using one of the available payment system. The control panel is very user-friendly and intuitive.

Credit card payments may be accepted via Authorize.net, PayPal, Interkassa (Eastern Europe), Stripe and 2Checkout. Subscriptions (Recurring Billing) implemented using Authorize.net ARB, PayPal Subscriptions, Stripe Subscriptions and 2Checkout Recurring Billing. More gateways available as Add-ons.
